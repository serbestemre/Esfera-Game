Project is in android platform, so for correct testing android platform should be choosed in build settings.
While testing on unity, game screen should be sized to 1920*1080 portrait.
Scale must be 0.26(Scrolling down as much as possible on game screen)
"Maximize On Play" should be clicked for better testing.
For PC, player controllers are W,A,S,D keys.
Use Main Menu scene to start the game.
In main menu there are 3 options.
With start button level 1 will start.
With credits button you can see name of the developers, lecturer and owner of the music.
With exit button Player can exit the game. 
Back button will exit from the game in an android phone.
When the last level is finished player will be directed to credits scene.
After pressing back button in credits player will be directed to main menu scene.

Project is saved with the version of Unity 2018.3.0f2
Also we used android studio in order to switch platform.(Also there is a apk of the project in zip file)

We have only imported one asset package from asset store(Zero Rare).
This package includes sound effects which we used in our game.

Owner of the main menu song is Jonny Easton who has a youtube channel.
Also we have downloaded our images(Backgrounds and game icon) from: https://wallpaperscraft.com
